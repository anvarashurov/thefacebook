<h1> Welcome </h1>

<p> thefacebook is a single page web app that aims to .... ugh. You know what it should do very well. Let's just get on with it. </p>

<p>
As a new user, you first click <a href="http://thefacebook-aa.herokuapp.com/#/" target="_blank"> thefacebook </a> to access the website. If you are still reading this and have not yet clicked then you essentially missed the whole purpose of this long sentence. Anyways... here is the long link for the patient ones: http://thefacebook-aa.herokuapp.com/
</p>

<p> If you are doing it right, then you are happily greeted by this fabulous landing page that warmly welcomes you 
to this wonderful platform and kindly requests you to sign up!!!!! </p>

<!-- <p> Fast forward. </p> -->

<!--  I really do not want to compete with L.I.Tolstoy in number of characters written per Volume. Phew. </p> <span>Fun Edit: I actually tried to read <em> Anna Karenina </em> while skipping classes. </span> -->

<p>Essentially, if you head towards your profile page and click "Update Profile" button, then you are free to upload your own Profile and Wallpaper photos! Also, do you forget to add a cool Bio! Something deep pertaining life, existance, and mortality is always welcome. </p>
 <!-- Upload row nature photos! It's a command. -->

<p> Note how awesome of a user experinece it is to view changes before saving them. That's a lot of hard work, blood, and sweats! ... More like tears to be precise. </p>

<p> But, what can be cooler than John Locke adding you as a friend? Yaay.

<h3> That is it from me... for now </h3>

+ Tech used
    - JS
    - ReactJS
    - Ruby on Rails
    - PostgreSQL
    - AWS
    - Webpack
    - ...
    - ... It's hard to recall these things. But one thing for sure, I learned A LOT!

+ Future implementations
    - Sharing Post
    - Deleting / Editing Comments
    - Showing the list of Likers via Modal
    - NewsAPI to show latest World news
    - It's hard to stop. Facebook has many awesome features!

+ Future for me:
    - Personally, sky's the lim... Haha. When I am not watching high quality Premier League matches or listening to Le'Professeur's philosophy on human value and trust, I would love to explore the behind the scenes of a modern search engine. Specifically, how data is crawled, stored, fetched, indexed, optimized, and so on. I do have high level understanding of how things are managed but nothing is more valuable than getting the practical knowledge obtained through gettings hands dirty. To me, that is the short term record to hit and building thefacebook has slightly increased my chances of understanding more complex concepts... 

<h2> Thanks for stopping! </h2>

<p> I would love to hear your feedback: anvarashurov717 AT GoogleMail </p>
